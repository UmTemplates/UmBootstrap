## What It Does

UmbNav is a navigation menu builder for Umbraco. It provides a drag-and-drop property editor in the backoffice that lets content editors build and manage navigation menus with support for:

- Internal links to Umbraco content
- External URLs
- Nested/hierarchical menu items
- Custom labels and CSS classes

## How UmBootstrap Uses It

UmbNav powers the main site navigation. The property editor is added to document types that need a navigation menu, and the front-end renders the menu structure using Bootstrap's navbar component.
