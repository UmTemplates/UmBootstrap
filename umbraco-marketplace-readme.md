## Description
UmBootstrap is an Umbraco Website Starter Kit using Bootstrap Templates and a comprehensive Component Library all available for you to use in your projects.

What makes UmBootstrap different from other starter kits is that it is not installed via a Nuget Package on top of an existing Umbraco website, it 'is' an Umbraco website on installation as a dotnet project template.

## Features

At the heart of UmBootstrap is an Umbraco website containing:
* Page layout templates
* Section layout templates
* Component templates

All of these are constructed using Umbraco doctypes and datatypes and Bootstrap HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

UmBootstrap is designed to be used as a starter kit for building websites. It is not a theme or a package. It is a website that you can use as a starting point for your own website.

However, it is not a blank canvas. It is a fully functional website with a variety of page and section templates and a rich component library.

This is ideal if you are new to Umbraco and want to learn how to build websites using Umbraco and Bootstrap.

However, for more experienced developers, you may find that you want to remove some of the templates and components that you don't need or copy and paste the ones that you do need into your own website.
