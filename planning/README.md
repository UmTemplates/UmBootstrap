# Planning

This folder contains architectural decisions and design documents for UmBootstrap.

## Purpose

- Document significant architectural decisions
- Plan complex features before implementation
- Track design exploration and rationale

## Conventions

### Status Markers

Each planning document should include a status at the top:

```markdown
**STATUS:** DRAFT | IN PROGRESS | COMPLETED | ABANDONED
```

### Document Structure

```markdown
# Feature/Decision Name

**STATUS:** IN PROGRESS

## Overview

```

### Session Startup

When actively working on a planning document, add it to the "Planning Files" section in `CLAUDE.md` so Claude reads it at the start of each session.

## Issue Tracking

Use GitHub Issues and Projects for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Task tracking

Planning documents are for **design decisions and architecture** that need narrative explanation.
